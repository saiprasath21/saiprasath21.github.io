Hi! I'm Sai Prasath Suresh, a first year MS student at [GeorgiaTech](https://www.gatech.edu/) majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. In May 2022, I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) with a BS/MS degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

I'm passionate about solving complex real-world problems from a data driven perspective using **Machine Learning and Deep Learning** approaches. Considering the enormous scale and complexity at which businesses operate today, I believe that utilizing AI to drive business decisions and extract knowledge out of raw data is essential. 


Previously, I've worked across various domains in Machine Learning including Reinforement Learning, Continual Learning, Adversarial ML, and Natural Language Processing. Through multiple internships and projects, I've developed a deep understanding of various AI/ML concepts and tools. 

**I'm actively looking for Summer 2023 Internship opportunities in Data Science and Machine Learning**.
