Hi! I'm Sai Prasath Suresh, a second year MS student at [GeorgiaTech](https://www.gatech.edu/) majoring in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning. Previously I graduated from the [Indian Institute of Technology(IIT) Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) with a BS/MS degree in Computer Science and Engineering. 

My primary interest lies in researching and developing machine learning and deep learning methodologies for solving real-world problems. Currently, I am intrigued by the convergence of **language, graphs, and reinforcement learning** with a particular focus on exploring the impact of the recent proliferation of generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT on our lives.**
 
Previously, I've had the opportunity to work on various domains in machine learning including NLP, RL, Continual Learning and Adversarial ML. Through multiple internships and projects, I've developed a deep understanding of various AI/ML concepts and tools.

**I'm actively looking for fulltime opportunities in ML/AI (applied science roles) starting May 2024**.
