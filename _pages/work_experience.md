Sep 2021 - Apr 2022

[iTrust Labs](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/itrust-labs-home/), Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore

##### **Anomaly Detection in Multi Variate Time Series**
- Developed a dual attention (spatial and temporal) based LSTM/GRU model to pre-emptively detect anomalies in a power plant. 
- Minimized costs by reducing the false alarm rate to 0.21% with a high detection accuracy of 97.8%.    

##### **Semi-Supervised GAN based Trojan Detection**   
- Researched and implemented a novel semi-supervised GAN for detecting trojaned DNNs. 
- Enhanced detection capabilities by integrating a Denoising Autoencoder for attack agnostic one-class training. 
- Achieved state-of-the-art performance +3% AUC on computer vision tasks while reducing run-time by 15%.

Sep 2021 - Apr 2022

[Fraunhofer IOSB and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.iosb.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Germany

- Implemented black-box ZOO and FGSM attacks on DL based Intrusion Detection System. Handled system specific constraints: binary features, one-hot encoded variables, preserving attack capabilities. 
- Studied various defense mechanisms including adversarial training, defensive distillation, and denoising
autoencoder. 
- Integrated Explainable AI tools such as PDP Plots and SHAP to perform understandable and trustworthy decision making.

<!-- #### **Covid-19 Modeling Intern**  -->

Jul 2020 - Sep 2020

[PRETzel Group](https://pretzel.ece.auckland.ac.nz/#!home), University of Auckland, New Zealand

- Implemented agent(Stochastic Te Punaha Matatini) and differential equation(Modified SEIR, CovidSim 2.0) based
covid-19 models using hybrid automata using composition modelling. 
- Performed multi-model simulations with different plants and controllers to find the optimal control strategy.
- Analysed the trade off between the economic impact and the health impact by generating a pareto front using ϵ constraint method and particle swarm optimization.
